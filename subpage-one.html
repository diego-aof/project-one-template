				<p align="left">Coppola was first drawn to the story after reading the book by Jeffrey Eugenides in 1995, at the recommendation of musician Thurston Moore. Coppola said she felt really understood the teenage experience and the mystery that exists between boys and girls, as well as emotions. She has also said that if not for the book, she does not know that she would have a career in film. Coppola was scared to direct the film, but felt so connected to the material that she felt she needed to create it. Specifically, Coppola has highlighted the representation of teenagers “lazing around,” a situation she connected with but felt was not seen very much in films in any relatable way. The story’s theme of loss was a personal connection for Coppola after her oldest brother had died suddenly in a boating accident, though she says this personal connection was one she says she did not immediately realize. She wanted to make a quality film for young audiences and treat that group with respect and properly examine this deeply emotional period of childhood. The film was low budget and critics were supportive.Coppola credits the start of her career to the Cannes festival after the film premiered there, and has said that this film was what made her a film-maker.  The film has also been said to mark the point at which the public ceased to point to Coppola’s father as a reason for her success. Coppola’s father would not help her secure the rights to the novel, and so at that point she adapted the screenplay herself.
