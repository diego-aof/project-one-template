				Marie Antoinette was shot on location at the Château de Versailles.Coppola has stated that with time, reception to the film has strengthened and reception has warmed and that the film has found its own place, describing it has had more of a life now than when it first came out.Coppola has managed to forge a distinctive identity in spite of her father's reputation as a major figure in American cinema. Notably, a commonality of her films is that they all in some way touch on complex relationships between youth and age.The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation, Marie Antoinette, the three aforementioned films, all in some way approach issues of identity and the question of whether it is made or imposed, and do so through elements of teen films such as the rites-of-passage narrative and contemporary scores, yet still manage to maintain a specific European arthouse feeling It has also been suggested that Coppola herself identifies with film's young woman protagonist, characterized by a sense of naivety and uncertainty of the future.Coppola herself has claimed that she was initially pulled towards the character of Marie Antoinette as an innocent and caring character who found herself in a situation outside of her control, and that rather than creating a historical representation, she wanted to create a more intimate look into the world of the heroine.Scholars have highlighted the film as one that contains obvious parallels between Coppola's own life as a Hollywood “royal” and Marie Antoinette's position as the victim of xenophobia, malice, and envy.In terms of Coppola's personal connections to her films, scholars have described the films as “deliberately idiosyncratic,” as opposed to explicitly autobiographical.[47] Coppola has also not disputed viewers’ readings of her films as somewhat personal to her own life and story, and has claimed that her films are made more for friends and family than the outside world.In regards to the critics’ divided views of Marie Antoinette, it has been said that Coppola's use of travesty in the film could have been a factor in the industry's disparate opinions.Fashion, which can facilitate travesty, is a large part of Coppola's film in the ways it was used to represent the nature of the period of time and create mood
